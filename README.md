# Deep_Fish_counting

This project implements a deep learning solution for counting fish in underwater imagery, specifically focusing on the DeepFish dataset. The code provides a comprehensive data preparation pipeline using PyTorch, including resizing images, converting them to tensors, and normalizing pixel values.It uses torchvision library for datasets and transformations.  
 
 **Key Features: ** 
 
 Data preprocessing for DeepFish dataset 
 PyTorch-based data loading pipeline 
 Image resizing,
 tensor conversion,
 and pixel normalization
 Ready-to-use DataLoader instances for training and testing Usage
