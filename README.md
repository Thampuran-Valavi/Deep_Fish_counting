# Deep_Fish_counting

This project implements a deep learning solution for counting fish in underwater imagery, with a specific focus on the DeepFish dataset. The code establishes a comprehensive data preparation pipeline using PyTorch, encompassing tasks such as image resizing, tensor conversion, and pixel normalization. It leverages the torchvision library for datasets and transformations.

**Key Features:**

- Data preprocessing for DeepFish dataset
- PyTorch-based data loading pipeline
- Image resizing, tensor conversion, and pixel normalization
- Ready-to-use DataLoader instances for training and testing

**Usage:**

1. Download the dataset [here](http://data.qld.edu.au/public/Q5842/2020-AlzayatSaleh-00e364223a600e83bd9c3f5bcd91045-DeepFish/)
2. Clone the repository.
3. Customize the data path variable to point to your DeepFish dataset.
4. Run the script to set up the data pipeline.
5. Integrate this DataLoader into your deep learning model for fish counting.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
