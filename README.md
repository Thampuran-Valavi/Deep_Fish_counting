# Deep_Fish_counting
 Description: This project implements a deep learning solution for counting fish in underwater imagery, specifically focusing on the DeepFish dataset. The code provides a comprehensive data preparation pipeline using PyTorch, including resizing images, converting them to tensors, and normalizing pixel values. It leverages the torchvision library for datasets and transformations.  Key Features:  Data preprocessing for DeepFish dataset PyTorch-based data loading pipeline Image resizing, tensor conversion, and pixel normalization Ready-to-use DataLoader instances for training and testing Usage:  Clone the repository. Customize the data_path variable to point to your DeepFish dataset. Run the script to set up the data pipeline. Integrate this data loader into your deep learning model for fish counting. Dependencies:  Python 3.x PyTorch torchvision Author: Thampuran S Valavi
